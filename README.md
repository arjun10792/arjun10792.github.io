## Completed Projects
<br>

### Probabilistic method based document retrieval with dynamic inverted index maintenance
> To improve the search performance of real time document retrieval with dynamic inverted index, using probabilistic method. Deep learning method used is Doc2Vec. Storage is SAN based.
<br>

### Exhaustive evaluation of TCP Westwood and Westwood+ in Multirate 802.11

> Evaluation of the performance of TCP Westwood and Westwood+ was done in the presence of Rate Adaptation Algorithms such as ARF, AARF, ONOE and MINSTREL. The tool used was ns-3 and coding was done in C++.
<br>

### A new efficient approach to store and rate data in cloud server

> A new method was designed and implemented for storing text based documents on cloud (DaaS). Also a new way was implemented to rate text based documents. The implementation was done for Microsoft office based files. C# was the programming language used, while the tool used was Visual Basic. 

### Iterative Weiner Filter

> The project aims to provide high performance by modifying the Wiener filter. The PSNR value obtained were high and are used in biomedical images. It was implemented in Matlab.
<br>


### Traffic signal information using Electric Imp

> In this project, Electric Imp was used to receive traffic signal information in automobiles, by displaying the information on LCD. Traffic signal simulation was done to show vehicle drivers, information regarding signal time left, in every direction at a traffic signal. The programming language used was "C-based Squirrel".<br>


### C-Code Editor

> GUI based source code editor that edits program written in C language and also edits normal text document. Other than normal text editor features, it has features of syntax highlighting, braces matching and formatting options i.e. colour based formatting. JAVA was used to build this application.
<br>
